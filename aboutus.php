                  About 127 years ago, the population of Rajkot was nearly 25000 or less than that. At that time hardly any animals without owners were seen. Even then at that time Mahajan's forecast business person decided to establish a Panjarapole.
                </li>
                <li class="text-justify">
                  A few numbers of support-less animals were to be maintained. The first beginning of Rajkot Mahajan Panjarapole was at Kotharia Naka place. The religious minded, noble King of Rajkot allotted that place to mahajan. As time passed on, honourable King Late Bavajiraj allotted a huge land at about 2 Lakh Sq. Ft. at the bank of river Aji for maintenance and care taking purpose at a token price. At that time in the time of famine, the king came to help of panjarapole by bringing grass from south Gujarat.
                </li>   
                <li class="text-justify">
                In the history of Rajkot Mahajan Panjarapole the event which never happen had occurred. In Rajkot, a circus had come. While leaving from Rajkot, it left an elephant on the way who was not able to walk. 
                </li>   
              </ul>
            </div>

              <ul class="list theme-colored check">
                <li class="text-justify">
                The president of our panjrapole most respectable merchant Shri Durlabhjibhai Shamjibhai Virani having come to know this, with great action rescued that elephant in Rajkot Mahajan's Panjarapole for treatment and for creating wellness comfort to it. Nearly after two years when it died, to remove the dead body, about forty to fifty labourers were needed.
                </li>   
              </ul>
            </div>

                <li class="text-justify">
                  In the period about year 1966 when possession of panjarapole was taken by Shri Jayantibhai Shah and other workers, only 80 to 90 animals, rabbits and white pigeon etc. mute Living beings were there. But after 10 years period, the numbers of animals rapidly increased to thousand and thereafter in eight to ten years the number of animals became 1700 and daily expense was Rs. 5000/-, and today to maintain these living being, the amount of Rs. 150000- is required.
                  </li>
                  <li class="text-justify">
                    That means the expense increased too much to maintain them. About the year 1987, due to terrible famine, the farmers of villages with tears in their eyes were coming to Rajkot Mahajan Panjarapole to hand over their precious animals and then panjarapole willingly accept these animals.
                  </li>   
                  <li class="text-justify">
                  As there was no sufficient land the bullocks were to be taken to Race Course ground. The numbers of animals increased nearly 50000.

                  The Panjarapole maintained them for about one month, and there after Government of Gujarat maintained them. It was an unpredicted event of our panjarapole, which may hardly be seen in the world. When the Government closed this cattle camp, the collector handed over about 1700 weak animals to Rajkot Mahajan's Panjarapole. At that time the numbers of animals increased up to 5000 in Panajarapole. In the mist of such many problems the Rajkot Mahajan Panjarapole overcome cheerfully. All the animals whether they are buffaloes, bulls, donkeys or birds maintained carefully.

                  In this uncontrolled days/period the flame of killing is increased from day to day. Thousands of animals are thrown out to the slaughter house. Meat is exported in huge containers, but our Rajkot Mahajan's Panjarapole observing inheritance of culture and have saved thousands of animals-birds and have given shelter. In any circumstances animals are not given back to butchers. Even by fighting in court panjarapole saved them.

                By afraid from sin, some poor animal breeders do not sell their animals. Being poor, they do not earn any money of these living beings from butchers but bring them to our panjarapole. For their noble nature of mercy panjarapole accept their sheep-goats.

                In Indian culture, religion and tradition, animals of bovine community are as much dearer to the innocent and God-fearing rural people as their own family members.
